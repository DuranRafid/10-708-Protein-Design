# 10-708-Protein-Design
This repository contains the code used for our final project in CMU 10-708 Probailistic Graphical Models course. The project addresses the problem of generating proteins that have a high propensity for liquid-liquid phase separation. We designed a method based on adaptive machine-learning and active learning. Our adaptive machine learning based method uses Droppler as a surrogate model. 

We use random mutation as baseline. The codes for random mutation can be found in random_mutation.py.

The codes for our proposed pipeline is provided in Design_LLPS.py.

The dataset used in our experiments can be found in [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cH5kQwqX0Iyj95VefUybi49KDvJRWTbz?usp=sharing).
